##  Project Overview

The primary objective is to:
- Evaluate **sales performance** through KPIs like revenue, total quantity, and average order value.
- Understand **customer purchase behavior** and loyalty trends (single vs repeat customers).
- Analyze **product types, payment gateways, and regions** to identify high-performing areas.
- Present insights through an **interactive dashboard with slicers, drill-through features, and dynamic measure selectors**.

##  **Business Requirements**

The dashboard was designed to address the following business questions:
1. **Transactions Performance**  
   - **Net Sales** (sum of subtotal price)
   - **Total Quantity Sold**
   - **Net Average Order Value (AOV)** = Avg of subtotal price

2. **Customer Purchase Behavior**
   - **Total Customers** (unique buyers)
   - **Single Order Customers** vs **Repeat Customers**
   - **Customer Loyalty & Repeat Rate**

3. **Retention & Value KPIs**
   - **Lifetime Value (LTV)** = Net Sales ÷ Total Customers
   - **Repeat Rate** = Repeat Customers ÷ Total Customers
   - **Purchase Frequency** = Total Distinct Orders ÷ Total Customers

4. **Product & Payment Analysis**
   - Identify top-performing **product types**.
   - Analyze **payment gateway usage** and customer preferences.

##  **Key Visuals & Features**
